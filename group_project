NAME OF PROJECT HERE

Initial concept:
Our initial concept was based off the cards given to us in class which were to create a game based off of jealousy and to 
include something wet. We came up with a multiplayer cereal stacking game. 
You would play against other players and be timed on how fast you can stack your cereal bowls without them tipping over.

Second round:
When we had class at the Engagement Lab, we decided to paper prototype our game using red plastic cups two dice. 
Going around in a circle, players could either take two cups from the stack in the middle or take three cups from another player.
