Start with 1 Bean Well, and 5 Foundation Cups, 2 of which can be upside down. First to a tower 5 high wins.

During the player’s turn they can:
Take 2 cups from the middle and add them upright to your tower
Take 1 cup from the middle and add it upside down to your tower
Steal from another player:
Roll the d6, and steal the corresponding number of cups from one or more players. 
	1 or 2 = Steal 1 Cup
	3 or 4 = Steal 2 Cups
	5 or 6 = Steal 3 Cups
After you steal, the targeted player adds twice the die roll in beans to their Bean Well.
	Pour your beans onto your own tower to FORTIFY it.
	Pour your beans onto another player’s tower to knock it over.
If any non-foundation cups fall over, they are returned to the center. If a foundation cup is knocked over, it cannot be replaced.
